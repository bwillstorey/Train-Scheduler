## About
A train scheduler app developed using Firebase to store entered data in a Firebase database. In addition to Firebase, jQuery, Javascript, Bootstrap, and HTML5/CSS3 were used to build the application. The user is enters train information into the form, and the Moment.js API is used to calculate the "Next Train" time as well as the calculate the number of minutes to the next train. A click event listener pushes user entered data to Firebase and then manipulates the DOM to add that data along with the 2 moment calculations. Data is real-time and updates based upon current time at your location.
